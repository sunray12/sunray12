- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunray12
- 👀 I’m interested in gagets, arduino, pi, coding(badly) and developing Apple iOS apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode 14.0, everything I can about iOS development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on first learning the Apple dev environment and second developing a series of small iOS apps that harness the latest Apple technologies, learn a lot to move onto bigger and better things and make some pocket money on the way.
